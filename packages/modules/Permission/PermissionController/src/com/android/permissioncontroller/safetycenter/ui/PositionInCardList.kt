/**
 * Determines the correct background drawable for a given element in the Safety Center card list.
 *
 * This class helps transform a flat list of elements (which are typically Preferences in the
 * PreferenceScreen's recycler view) into a visually grouped list of cards by providing the correct
 * background drawable for each element based on both its position in the flat list of elements and
 * its conceptual position in the card list. While Preferences have a nested XML structure, with
 * Preferences nested inside of PreferenceGroups, they are displayed as a flat list of views, with
 * the PreferenceGroup's view inserted as a header above its constituent preference's views.
 *
 * A list is a group conceptually-related of cards. The top card in the list has large top corners
 * and the bottom card in the list has large bottom corners. Corners between cards in the list are
 * small. In the Safety Center, the entry list is a single list.
 *
 * A card is a group of one or more elements that appear as a single visual card, without corners
 * between its constituent elements. In the Safety Center, a single expanded entry list group is a
 * single card composed of a list of separate preferences (one for the header and one for each entry
 * in the group).
